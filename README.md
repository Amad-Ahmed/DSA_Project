# DSA_Project
This project was my Data structures and Algorithms project in C++. what basically this project included that we were asked to parse a csv file containing data
which could be about anything so we selected the following dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/START-UMD/gtd/version/3
The dataset contained information about terrorism events in the world and their history so we parsed this data into our custom classes
We performed multiple operations and put to use multiple programming concepts such as
1.Object-Oriented Programming
2.Operator Overloading
3.Implementation of data structures 
4.Managing the conversion between multiple data types and memory allocations
5.How to effectively and efficiently store the dataset in the most viable data structures
